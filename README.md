# Lab00
I have worked with Git and GitHub for a while now, but the projects are always so few and far between that assignments like this will always send me scrambling
a little bit to refresh myself on commands, lingo, and where things are! I don't really have any comments or questions quite yet, aside from just hoping that I 
did this assignment correctly! With only a handful of us in class, I would hate to be the one that botched it haha.

Oh! I should mention that I used ChatGPT 5.2 to refresh my memory on some git commands.
